# Overlap

This is a group scheduling app written in React.  It allows users to create schedules with specific dates, a date range, or days
of the week.  The created schedule can be shared with a simple URL and users can add their schedule availability without
needing to log in.  The app then displays the "overlap" of the availability of the users.
